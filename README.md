CyberCheck was built to make learning cybersecurity more fun and hands-on. Designed for beginners or anyone who wants a quick way to explore real-world threats and how to spot them.

Personally built using Python with AI-assisted code. Firewall rules were configured manually, specific ports were handpicked for Nmap scanning, the cyber game was fully custom-made, and password-checking logic was personally written to flag weak and strong passwords

Port Scanner: Uses nmap to check for open ports that could leave your system vulnerable.

Password Checker: Scans a list of user passwords and points out the weak ones using a custom wordlist.

Security Report: Combines port scan results and weak passwords to give you an overall risk score.

Interactive Cyber Quiz: Tests  knowledge about safe ports, strong passwords, risky websites, and dangerous IP addresses.
